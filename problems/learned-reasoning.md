What is reasoning? How does it improve learning?

Allows access to other structured knowledge?

#### Reasoning with learned concepts

Computers can easily reason about symbols. (With the advent of deep learning -- not true...) Computers can learn concepts and attach them to symbols. Thus computers can reason about learned concepts.

[Differentiable ILP](?)

#### Learning to reason

If reasoning is the manipulation of learned concepts, then learning to reason would be: learning different operations/functions to compose, reduce, add, intersect, ... learned concepts. See [SCAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03389) for the possible solution.

(Learning a model! To get from A to B. [TreeQN](?))

#### Smooth transition between cognition and perception

When should symbols be atteched and the reasoned with? As early as possible, or depending on how often we have to do the computation? Or ?

#### Reasoning with language

Currently research considers reasoning with logic, or with a model. Language is one of the ways humans reason (also have visual/spatial reasoning?). I would call language an approximate type of reasoning. What are the benefits of this sort of system? What are the flaws?

Fake news!

#### Reasoning about reasoning

Aka meta reasoning.
