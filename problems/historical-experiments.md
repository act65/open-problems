In economics ... by chance we see a natural experiment.

The conditions necessary for this are

A counterfactual.

Both A and B start at some 'similar' state, S, but then a single cause, X, acts in only A (but we can assume the cause of A is not linked to any effects). Thus, any effects we see, Y, are caused by X.


Similar in the sense that all the ways A and B are dissimilar are independent of any effects due to X.


For example.

Someone calls a big white feathery thing in the middle of a lake a 'swan'. Ok, so know I know what swans are. Another day, I see a big black feathery thing flying over head and I ask what it is. 'Oh, that is a swan'.



Consider a controlled experiment. We have a population of people, they they are split into two groups, A, B. A receives an intervention and B receives nothing. We make the assumption that A and B differ only by the intervention. That is to say, before the intervention, sim(A, B) ~= 1. Now this isn't true, as different people are participating in A and B. And this hints at a deeper problem with testing causality in reality. It is not possible to create the same environment twice, we cannot run two realities in parallel and see the result of any intervention we make, unless the many-worlds interpretation is correct (unlikely if you ask me).

<!--
We also assume that the act of doing the experiment is independent from any effects we see?!
People knowing they are in an experiment.
People being disrupted from their daily routine to participate in the experiment.

Also assume that the delivery on the control/intervention is independent w.r.t any effects.

So, what if we could further weaken this measure of similarity? The requirements for A and B to be similar with respect to a given intervention, X, are;
* any differences between A and B, defined as C (= A - B) are independent from any effects, Y (= A' - B' - C = A' - A + B' - B = dA/dX - dB/dX). (need to include their natural rate of change? dA/dt?)
* ?

So in what cases in this could this help?
* Take A and B to be Auckland and Wellington.





Causality still doesn't make sense to me!? F = ma is not a casual statement. It does not say that acceleration of a mass causes force anymore than a force on a mass causes acceleration. What is a social/economic/political version of this? Well educated people in parliament causes good governance is the same thing as good governance by parliament ...???
