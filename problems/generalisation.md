Symbolic versus learned?





#### Zero-shot

If one-shot learning is: "Learning from a single example" then zero-shot learning would be: "making a damn good guess".

Given examples about X, can we learn about Y?

A possible hypothesis for how we manage this is that we hypothesise about causes, we create models/explanations, which are occasionally accurate and generalise wonderfully.
