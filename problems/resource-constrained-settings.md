Right now deep learning only works with lots of data, lots of compute, (and lots of patience...).
Given that we are seeing DL massively scaled across the internet, small wins in efficiency can make a big deal. 

#### Small compute

Can we save compute by  

#### Small memory

Online algorithms.

#### Small data

?
