It is well known that you can trade compute for accuracy (quality of gradient estimates, or even compute second order info), or time and memory (recompute vs remember in BPTT), or ...
For each given application the requirements will be different. Sometimes memory is more imporant than time, sometimes vice versa.
Ultimately we would like to learn the most efficient behaviour given the requirement of the application.
