Supervised learning requires annotated data!
This means: data is where the value is at. So, what incentives are there to open data to the public? None. Unless, ?.

Possible (half) solution?
A cheaper way to annotate data. Hierarchical label structures? Interactive exploration of data (that is also fun)?

New and clever ways of extracting annotations from existing datasets. Something like the how unsupervised methods extract labels from the existing data. Train on context, recontruction, ?, real/fake, ...

Projects that satisfy these wants;
* Interactive tensorboard visualisations. Ability to add meta data while viewing the [projector](http://projector.tensorflow.org/).
* ?
