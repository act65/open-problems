Computers can easily reason about symbols. (With the advent of deep learning) Computers can learn concepts and attach them to symbols. Thus computers can reason about learned concepts. The final step: learn to reason about learned concepts.

If reasoning is the manipulation of learned concepts, then learning to reason would be: learning different operations/functions to compose, reduce, add, intersect, ... learned concepts. See [SCAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03389) for the possible solution.
