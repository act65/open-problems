Humans evolved in a world where we needed to make predictions quickly, given little information and resources.
Having to learn and predict with the same set of minimal resources. Use for prediction now, and use for consolidation later?


- Aligning delayed signals with each other and rewards.
- Sharing resources for learning and inference. Might not be able to do both at the same time...
- Predictive processing. Error correcting (surfing uncertainty)
