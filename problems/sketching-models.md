What if there was a high level language for describing what a NN does/has learn? It could then make sense to efficiently communicate this, or to store it in compressed form, or ...?

Passing around models as a first class function. WHat about composing different learned models?

Given enough trained models, and their respective data. I could make sense to learn a sketch of each!?
