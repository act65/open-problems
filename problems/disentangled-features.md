In the ideal case we could apply unsupervised learning to a dataset and get back a model of the true generatve process.

However, our current best approach, DL, can only learn correlations. So we are left with finding the patterns

Possible to learn more than correlations without interferance? Possibly, if we have ??? (Bernhards thingy -- ternary relations).
