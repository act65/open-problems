Falsification is ???...

The ability to generate informative queries can save a lot of compute (ref?).

- experiment design
- hypothesis generation
- active learning

Counterfactuals and falsification

Ideal case is that we have some oracle (maybe physics for experiment design, a database for query generation, ...) that is expensive to call. Given what a learner knows, its next call to the oracle should be to falsify its leading hypothesis.
