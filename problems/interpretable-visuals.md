It is hard to get an intuitive understanding of what has been learned.

Current tools for this are;

* saliency/propagate gradients back,
* ?

but they are underwhelming.


Better ways to visalise;
* computations and their resource use would be good? Visualising the big Ohs?
* the learning dynamics
* ?
