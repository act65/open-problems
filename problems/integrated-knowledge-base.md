Relate to real-world?
There exists a lot of knowledge. To make use of it we need it to be integrated/connected/(?).

## Leverage existing knowledge

?

## Life long learning

Life long learning is hard because as we learn new things, we need to make space for these new things (finite storage).
So we must selectively forget irrelevant details.

In the ideal case we would rework our entire memory to include the new data we have received and attempt to compress this to more efficient remember as much as possible.

Aka online learning? What is the difference?
Not only do we care about a finite memory footprint, but reusing/transferring knowledge from the past.

## Exploring incomplete databases

What about exploring new parts of the graph? May still have ???
Not sure how this fits in here.

Propagating truth across the graph. Combinatorally generating new nodes.
