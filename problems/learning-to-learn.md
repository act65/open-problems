If computers are ever going to take over the world, they will need to be able to learn to learn. This kind of self-optimisation, is what I hold dear and I believe that makes us 'intelligent'.
Learning is great, as we are currently finding out, however, there have been a few different learning algorithms over the years. First nature started out with natural selection, but it is incredibly slow O(billions of years...).

All it really means is understanding a given learning problem in more depth so we can include 'better' inductive biases in the optimiser.
