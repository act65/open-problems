Define: Deep learning is ... using sgd + ad. It is a big deal because it allows faster learning than ...
Let's apply this approach to as many things as possible.

There are many functions that are not currently differentiable,
What does differentiability buy us?

- trees (diff boundary trees)
- Graphs

differentiable indexing.
differentiable sparse gating
