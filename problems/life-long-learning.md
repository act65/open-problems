Life long learining is hard because as we learn new things, we need to make space for these new things(finite storage).
So we must selectively forget irrelevant details.

In the ideal case we would rework our entire memory to include the new data we have recieved and attempt to compress this to more efficient remember as much as possible.

Aka online learning? What is the difference?
Not only do we care about a inite memory footprint, but reusing/transfering knowledge from the past.
