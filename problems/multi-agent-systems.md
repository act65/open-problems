Why is this important?
We want modular learning system, this means we need multiple loss fns with different learners.
But how should learners interact to minimize a loss. What happens if some learner want to maximise the loss as well.


- Dynamical systems
- Mechanism design
- Mutli-objective optimisation
- Type systems(?)
- Modular and first class networks
<!-- how does this relate to reasoning??? -->

<!--
i think there might be a couple separate problems here
- stability in optimising multiple losses
- manipulating modules
- sharing? transfer? ??

-->

Ensembles?
