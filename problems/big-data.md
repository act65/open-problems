Machine learning is about finding patterns in data. Over the last few years datasets have been rapidly increasing in size, and for good reason. The larger the dataset, the more robust and accurate the learned algorithm. However, as these datasets increase in size we start to encounter new problems. Requiring $$$ for electricity, ...
making ML only for the rich and powerful. We need ...

Dont want to have to train on multi epochs when the size of the dataset is large.
Want sublinear costs in; memory, compute, data,

- Mixture of experts
- Active learning

When you have a lot of data... Unsupervised/reinforcement!
