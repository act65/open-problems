Insert pic of lion.

How do you determine if the image you are looking at is a lion?
Ok, now write that process down as a program. Oh... That's really hard.

If we can write what we want down as a clear function/equation, then we can probably optimise it. If not. Hmm.

Machine learning allows us to 'show' the computer what we want by example. Pairs for images and their labels, ...

GANs? Allow us to extend this ...

What about generators of goals? (that RL stuff?)

<!-- So this is closely related to learning loss functions! -->
