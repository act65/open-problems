Open problems. Largely biased by what I find interesting and have happened to stumble over. See [here](https://act65.github.io/open-problems/)

What about;

* disentangling representations..
* a richer type system for learning systems.
* reuseable atoms
* learning independent meaningful modules
* many output classes
* combining multimodal inputs
* neuromorphic chips
