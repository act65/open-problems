title: Open problems v2

Open problems. Largely biased by what I find interesting and have happened to stumble over. See [here](https://act65.github.io/open-problems/)

What about;

* reusable atoms and learning independent meaningful modules
* many output classes
* combining multimodal inputs
* Keeping it simple. simplicity/beauty as a prior. iterative construction. measure beauty?
* Adaptive systems???
* hierarchical clustering!?
* ?
