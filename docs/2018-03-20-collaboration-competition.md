Collaboration and competition.

Under which circumstances will two agents collaborate or compete?

## Modeling your opponent

How smart do you think your opponent is. Lazy.

Why? Greater efficiency can be made by making assumptions (assuming they are right...). Stereotyping different players behaviors/strategies. Effectively it allows us to make more assumptions and do a better job of modeling the roll out accurately, thus reducing search space.


## Explaining reasoning (teaching another)



## Receiving reasoning (working with another)


## Asymmetric information

Tax law example.

## Specialsing, trade and trust!?

!?!?
