In the ideal case we could apply unsupervised learning to a dataset and get back a model of the true generative process.

However, our current best approach, DL, can only learn correlations. So we are left with finding the patterns

Possible to learn more than correlations without interference? Possibly, if we have ??? (Bernhards thingy -- ternary relations).


Want this to be somewhat modeled after grammaticalization and related to compositionality/merge.
