### Contributing

I have cited papers based on;
- having read it.
- enjoying it.
- learning something from it.

Not based on;
- whether it was first,
-

### Goals

Machine learning as a research field seems to be doing just fine without me.
Where should I allocate my time? Which problems are most important?
How can I be most effective? What are the deepest/biggest problems?

Writing this will hopefully help me;
- understand the differences, and similarities, between fields of work
-

Help me keep an eye out for problems that I hadnt realised were problems.
